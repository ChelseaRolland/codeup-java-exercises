     Array Basics

     Create a class inside of src named ArraysExercises. Create a main method for this class to do your work.

     What happens when you run the following code? Why is Arrays.toString necessary?

     Copied to clipboard
     int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
     System.out.println(numbers);
     Create an array that holds 3 Person objects. Assign a new instance of the Person class to each element. Iterate through the array and print out the name of each person in the array.

     Create a static method named addPerson. It should accept an array of Person objects, as well as a single person object to add to the passed array. It should return an array whose length is 1 greater than the passed array, with the passed person object at the end of the array.
