     - AVERAGE_COST_OF_DISH_IN_CENTS - an integer constant set to 13000
     - shoutDishName() - that takes in a Dish object and prints out the name in all caps
     - analyzeDishCost() - that takes in a Dish object and will print out either “More expensive than average” or “Less expensive than average”, depending on the value of the dish costInCents compared to AVERAGE_COST_OF_DISH_IN_CENTS
     - flipRecommendation() - that takes in a Dish object and reverses the wouldRecommend boolean value
     Try out the DishTools methods with Dish objects in the DishTest main method
